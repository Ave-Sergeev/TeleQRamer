# TeleQRamerThis project is a game and not should be taken as a serious development.The project has 2 features:1) QR code generation uses the QRGen library   (https://github.com/kenglxn/QRGen), and has a default JPG size of 250x250 (can be changed in the application config).2) The token for shortURL is implemented on ULID (https://github.com/ulid/spec), and the longURL -> shortURL bundle is stored in Redis. For local use with low load, such an implementation is quite sufficient, and it will guarantee (conditionally) the uniqueness of the keys.P.S. Important clarification:In reality, a completely different architecture and technologies would be used for a combat project. Please do not take the game project seriously.
